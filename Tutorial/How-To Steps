2. Click on the “New Question Type” button. You may have to authorize the program and then re-click on it. After running, it should create a new sheet.
3. Once a new sheet is created, fill in the information at the top by typing in:
  a. A name for this type of question
  b. Names for the variables in the question, and
  c. Which variable for the final question to ask about (you can write RandomVar() to have it pick a random variable)
4. Create a template for the pseudocode underneath the row that says “Pseudocode Outline”. 
  a. Start by clicking “Insert Block at End”. This will create a new dropdown menu.
  b. From the dropdown menu, select what type of code block you would like to add. Indented blocks will automatically create new dropdown menus to select another code block from.
  c. Edit any part of the outline in the gray cells you would like to change. 
  d. View a preview of the question at the bottom with the random values filled in, and change the outline accordingly to get the type of question you want
5. Once you have created the outlines for the different types of question you want in your quiz, go to the “Quiz Builder” sheet to create a Google quiz form

  b. Pick a name for the quiz in the gray cell
  c. Click the “Create Quiz!” button. After a few seconds, a link to the Google quiz should appear in the sheet.
