# AP-CSP-Psuedocode-Question-Generator
This repository contains Google Apps Script code for a google spreadsheet that can create automatically-generated AP Computer Science Principles pseudocode questions. The user defines the outline of the code, and then the Apps Script fills in random values and turns it into a multiple choice question. Also contains documentation and tutorials.
